# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers among women 
worldwide , representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer 
related deaths according to global statistics, making it asignificant 
public health problem in todayâ€Ÿs society , it occurs in women 
at any stage after puberty but with increasing rates in the later life.
Therefore , Machine Learning technique can contribute to the process of 
prediction and early diagnosis of breast cancer. The Requirements of time 
is to develop the technique which gives minimum error to increase accuracy.
Three Algorithm logistic regression , Random forest and KNN which 
predict the breast cancer outcomes have been compared in the project. All 
experiments are executed in JUPTYER PLATFORM. The purposed work can be 
used to predict the outcome of different technique and suitable technique can be 
used depending upon requirement. This project is carried out to predict the 
accuracy.
